# 👋 Welcome to Dennis' Tech Journey

I'm transitioning from **event decorating** to building in **tech, AI, and web design**.

This is my creative lab — a place for:

- 🚀 Exploring GitHub and web tools
- 🎙️ Hosting AI podcast projects
- 🧠 Experimenting with CapCut, coding, and content creation

👉 Visit my live site: [stackwithdennis.github.io/my-first-repo](https://stackwithdennis.github.io/my-first-repo/)

Stay tuned — it's just the beginning!
